shit that's broke

-chopping trees is done from a distance
-some doors don't open/gates
-most ladders work now
-the smelting menu only works when you select make 1
-mining is laggy as balls
-running is unreliable (not a problem with unlim running)
-some anvils don't work even with a hammer
-pickpocket stalls are fucked (less fucked, but fucked).
-no music.
-big nets don't work.
-shops can get full and crash people who interact with them (tangentally fixed by there being more shops now)
-al karhid furnace still not able to be used
-stalls only give dueling rings
-using a dueling ring produces an empty vial.
-On the RC guy in Alhazard. You have every altar listed but Chaos.
-selecting "climb up" on the middle ladder of a 3 ladder stack goes down...
-only cut willows when i approach them from the left
-essence isn't mineable
-fly fishing fails to use feathers
-runecrafting portals don't work (the 4 elemental ones do now)
-add a buy x feature
-friends list can fail to update
-fix a gate in the wild
-ladders on wolf mountain send you to taverly dungeon/the ladder out of taverly dungeon sends you to wolf mountain(down ladder code #1759, up #1755)...  bigger issue is the 3 ladders have the same code, so need to do that by player positions...  and find the Ice Caverns coordinates
-tallys "locate" doesn't work
-mahogany trees can't be cut
-catching anchovies says "you catch shrimp", catching salmon says "you catch trout" Fishing.java needs rewritten as it's all kinds of over complicated and messed up
-ghostly cloak goes in your weapon slot
-Some spells may not use elemental magic staves correctly
-telegrab doesn't work (how to remove item from ground)
-Add Linux file system support (eg search for cache in x directory)
