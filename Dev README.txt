First, thanks for at least being interested in helping.  

Please get the devclient @ https://www.dropbox.com/s/25odt4f6kqpldrc/VidyaScape%20Dev%20Client.zip.  
You should have the cache already, but it's included anyways, the folder goes on your C: drive.  
This client is setup to connect to a local server.  You run the server with Run.bat, then you can 
connect with the client.  This allows you a live development enviroment when you want to test things.
Try not to push a version of your code with your character file and a password that you don't want to
share, you can have git ignore it with .gitignore, lookup how to use it if you want.

You'll need to shutdown a server you're running before you can recompile.
