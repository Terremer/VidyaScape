First, thanks for at least being interested in helping.  

Please get the devclient @ [LINK].  You should have the cache already, but it's included anyways, and the folder goes on your C: drive.  This client is setup to connect to a local server.  You run the server with Run.bat, then you can connect with the client.  Try not to push a version of your code with your character file and a password that you don't want to share, you can have git ignore it with .gitignore, lookup how to use it if you want.
